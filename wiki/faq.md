## Troubleshooting

### Mod doesn't work
Our H60 pack requires two mods to work correctly:
<li> <a href = "https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1745501605">Itself</a>
<li> <a href = "https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1745501106">Hatchet framework</a>

The mod is providing you with hiqh quality helicopter models and interiors, while the Hatchet fraemwork makes sure that your helicopter is interactive. <br>
