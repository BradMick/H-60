# What are the future plans?

## When are you releasing?
---
When we feel like it is an appropriate moment to release.

--
## Will there be texture templates?
---
Yes.

--
## Are you planning on...
---
Yes, we're planning for literally everything, but what we actually make will depend on what we have the time and motivation to do, lightning round:

 - Special forces variants(MH-60M + LASS/MLASS)
:white_check_mark:  Likely, including functionality for the weapons and the radar, cockpit will stay the same as -60M

 - M240 / door gun variety
Low priority, doesn't have much gameplay impact

 - Navy stuff
Maybe MH-60S, definitely not MH-60R

- UES, different rotor blades
:heavy_minus_sign:  Maybe if we're doing cosmetic model changes anyways, but generally it's not priority

 - TFAR Support
Nothing in cockpit, just same baseline same compatibility config as all other mods

- Advanced Flight Model
:white_check_mark: Yes, it's what we focus on in development

 - Better damage handling
:white_check_mark: Yes, it's fucky but we strongly want to reduce the explodeyness

--
## Will the interaction be MP compatible
---
Yes, we intend for the whole aircraft to be properly set up for multi-crew use.

--
## Can I test it
---
Yes! Check out #announcements in the [discord](https://discord.gg/4AYEfFD)
