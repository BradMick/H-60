## 1.3 Interaction

Once you have the mod installed and are in the blackhawk, the normal keybind for this is "F". When you move your head around in game at certain points a circle will apear like below with the keybind that you have assigned.

The second type of interaction thats built in is with the mouse wheel, in a case where we have a switch its either OFF/ON or OFF/ON/OFF. This is the case for most of the switches on the overhead panel where you deal with the start up of the helicopter.

There are also a few rotary switches that work on the similar basis that affect lighting currently.
